    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Anton SÃ¸nderskov, and I'm a 20-year-old full-time software developer. For the past five years, I've been programming on and off, which I did while attending gymnasium, the equivalent of high school in Denmark.</p>
    <p>My interests lie in business, engineering, psychology, philosophy, and health. And, of course, spending time with my friends is important to me, too.</p>
    <p>I've created various projects, both for fun and for clients, which you can see on the projects page. I also write blog posts on various topics, which you can find on the blog page</p>
    <p>Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or via email if you have any questions or just want to connect!</p>
